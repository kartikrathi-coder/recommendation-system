Music recommendation system - Content based filtering. 
==============================

The Songs Recommendation System project leverages machine learning algorithms to analyze user preferences and recommend personalized music selections. Utilizing user listening history, genre preferences, and collaborative filtering, the system predicts and suggests songs that align with individual tastes, enhancing the overall music discovery experience for users.
